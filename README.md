# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis
Client asked for an analysis of school performance by examining standardized test scores, school size, school type, and budget. Client also noted that the 9th grade scores of Thomas High School were suspected of academic dishonestly and requested that they be removed. The majority of the questions from this challenge involve how this effects the results.
## Resources
- Data Source: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.10 (64-bit), Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8

- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  
  While a decrease was observed in the Thomas High School metrics, it was not a great enough decrease to change the rankings.
  
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grades
      
    These graphs are only effected by replacing the 9th grade Thomas High School grades with nan. The remaining cells were not effected by the removal.
  
  - Scores by school spending
